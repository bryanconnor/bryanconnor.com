      <p>After <a href="<?php echo html($site->url()) ?>/work/nomadic">upgrading Nomadic’s learning platform</a> we turned our attention to how the platform’s content is produced. The goal was to enable the content team to create and customize Field Manuals more quickly and easily for clients, supporting Nomadic’s growth strategy.</p>

      <h3>STARTING POINT</h3>
      <p>Nomadic’s original CMS got the job done, but to keep up with a growing roster of clients it needed serious augmentation. Only a few people at the company used the original CMS, and Field Manuals required too much manual customization by developers after the content was in place.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image "><img src="<?php echo url('content/work/nomadic-cms/original-cms.gif') ?>" / ></div>
  </div>
  <div class="rsContent cms-slide-4 centered-block">
    <div class="text">
      <p>The new CMS has two principle areas of focus: the <strong>admin</strong> and the <strong>editor</strong>. Through wireframing we explored the broad strokes of the admin and editing user experience before starting in on front-end prototypes. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="rsContent cms-slide-5 left-text">
    <div class="text">
      <h3>THE ADMIN</h3>
      <p>The first step was making sure it was easy to manage programs and the Field Manuals they contain. A two panel approach allows field manuals to be moved between programs, usually after they had be cloned from an original. Entire programs can even be cloned (and later customized) for new clients, all in a single screen.</p>

  <div class="rsContent cms-slide-6 left-text">
    <div class="text">
      <h3>THE EDITOR</h3>
      <p>The Editor has all the tools the content team needs to create a Field Manual from scratch. Content elements can be anything from text to video, audio, quizzes, polls and discussions. Our goal was to have the creation process reflect the look of the final Field Manual as much as possible.</p>

  <div class="rsContent cms-slide-7 left-text">
    <div class="text">
      <h3>SECTION &amp; MEDIA LIBRARIES</h3>
      <p>As authors plan new Field Manuals they need to be able to explore content already in use. To address this we added the <strong>Section</strong> and <strong>Media</strong> libraries which allow to you search and filter available content across all Field Manuals. Drawing from a reusable section library makes for faster and more consistent Field Manual construction.</p>

  <div class="rsContent cms-slide-8 left-text">
    <div class="text">
      <h3>VERSION CONTROL</h3>
      <p>Multiple editors, along with the ability to clone Field Manuals, meant the platform needed a form of version control. We cooked up an inline comparison showing the before and after for any individual content element. </p>

      <h3>WHO'S THERE?</h3>
      <p>My favorite little feature is an indicator in the bottom right that lets you know when someone else is editing the same Field Manual as you.</p>
