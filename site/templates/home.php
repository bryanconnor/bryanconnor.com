      <p>The original platform laid a good foundation but didn’t feel like a coherent digital learning space. </p>

  <div class="rsContent slide-library left-text">
    <div class="text ">
      <h3>THE LIBRARY</h3>
      <p>The first major improvement was a clear library of content. Field Manuals began to feel like independent elements, each with their own title, cover image, and level of completion.</p>

      <p>Each field manual is self-contained but its elements are accessible in different ways throughout the platform. For example, many elements can be favorited for quick reference at a later date.</p>

    <div class="text ">
       <h3>CONVERSATIONS</h3>
      <p>Each Field Manual contains its own debate section but the conversation hub collects them all into one central location. It also allows users to start new conversations outside of those set up by program administrators so they can discuss the content on their own terms. </p>

      <h3>FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT</h3>
      <p>I also contributed heavily to the front-end development of the new platform. One of Nomadic's goals is to enable learning anywhere so we engineered the platform to be just as responsive as the learning materials it houses. </p><p>I worked closely with <a href="https://github.com/junhonomad">Jun Ho</a> at Nomadic all the way through implementation, making adjustments as we went. Some of the front-end work was also completed with the help from the team at <a href="http://www.inthebackforty.com/">Back Forty</a>.

      <p>After <a href="#nomadic-platform-1">upgrading Nomadic’s learning platform</a> we turned our attention to how the platform’s content gets produced.

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="rsContent cms-slide-3 left-text">
    <div class="text ">
    	<h3>STARTING POINT</h3>
      <p>Nomadic’s original CMS got the job done but to keep up with a growing roster of clients it needed serious augmentation. Only a few people at the company used the original CMS and Field Manuals required too much manual customization by developers after the content was in place.</p>
    </div>
<!--     <div class="image "><img src="<?php echo url('content/work/nomadic-cms/Nomadic-CMS-Editor.gif') ?>" / ></div>
 -->  
	</div>
	<div class="rsContent cms-slide-4 centered-block">
    <div class="text">
      <p>The CMS has two principle areas of focus: the <strong>admin</strong> and the <strong>editor</strong>. Through wireframing we explored the broad strokes of the admin and editing user experience before starting in on front-end prototypes. </p>
    </div>
	</div>
	<div class="rsContent cms-slide-5 left-text">
    <div class="text">
    	<h3>THE ADMIN</h3>
      <p>The first step was making sure it was easy to manage programs and the Field Manuals they contain. A two panel approach made sense to allow field manuals to be moved between programs, usually after they’d be cloned from an original. Entire programs can even be cloned (and later customized) for new clients, all in a single screen.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image "><img src="<?php echo url('content/work/nomadic-cms/Nomadic-CMS-Management.png') ?>" / ></div>
	</div>

	<div class="rsContent cms-slide-6 left-text">
    <div class="text">
    	<h3>THE EDITOR</h3>
      <p>The Editor has all the tools the content team needs to create a Field Manual from scratch. Content elements can be anything from text to video, audio, quizzes, polls and discussions. Our goal was to have the creation process reflect the look of the final Field Manual as much as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image "><img src="<?php echo url('content/work/nomadic-cms/Nomadic-CMS-Editor.gif') ?>" / ></div>
	</div>
  <div class="rsContent cms-slide-7 left-text">
    <div class="text">
      <h3>SECTION &amp; MEDIA LIBRARIES</h3>
      <p>As authors plan new Field Manuals they need to be able to explore content already in use. To address this we added the <strong>Section</strong> and <strong>Media</strong> libraries which allow to you search and filter available content across all Field Manuals. Drawing from a reusable section library makes for faster and more consistent Field Manual construction.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image "><img src="<?php echo url('content/work/nomadic-cms/Nomadic-Sections-Media.gif') ?>" style="width: 82%;" /></div>
  </div>
  <div class="rsContent cms-slide-8 left-text">
    <div class="text">
      <h3>VERSION CONTROL</h3>
      <p>Multiple editors, along with the ability to clone Field Manuals, meant the platform needed a form of version control. We cooked up an inline comparison showing the before and after for any individual content element. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="image"><img src="<?php echo url('content/work/nomadic-cms/Nomadic-Versioning.jpg') ?>" style="width: 90%;" /></div>
  </div>
  <div class="rsContent cms-slide-9 left-text">
    <div class="text">
      <h3>WHO'S THERE?</h3>
      <p>My favorite little feature is an indicator in the bottom right that lets you know when someone else is editing the same Field Manual as you.</p>

    <div class="text">
      <h3>PROGRESS</h3>
      <p>A few months later Scott reached out again as the team was preparing the product for launch. They wanted to iterate on the design and user experience and get some user-friendly prototypes in the hands of Baltimore City school teachers.</p>
      <p>We worked through static visual designs, interactive click-throughs and full-featured prototypes in code.</p>

    <div class="text">
      <h3>TEMPLATE LIBRARY</h3>

      <h3>TEACHER TESTED</h3>

      <p>The result was a fully featured lesson planning tool tailored to the tastes of teachers. </p>
