          <h2>Info</h2>

          <!--<p> <img src="<?php echo url('assets/images/bc-bio-pic.jpg') ?>" alt="Bryan Connor" class="bio-pic"/>Hey all, I'm Bryan, a designer living and working in Baltimore, MD. From my home base I partner with great product teams from all over, thanks to the wonders of the internet.</p> -->

          <!-- <p>I started <a href="http://thewhyaxis.info/">The Why Axis</a> for my thesis at <a href="http://www.mica.edu/">MICA</a> and there is where I continue to document data visualization's renewed importance in the digital age. I'm generally a big fan of anything that can expand human understanding.</p> -->
          <p>Every partnership is a unique combination of what each party brings to the table. These are the things I bring to the table:</p>
            
          <h3>&mdash; Fully Embeddable</h3>
          <p>Think of me as a new team-member, working closely with collaborators and adapting to existing processes and shifting roles. Working remotely, making progress, and in the office when it counts.</p>

          <h3>&mdash; Giving Form to Thought</h3>
          <p>My job is to create something we can react to. I'll even edit things right in front of you, adjusting to feedback and testing new ideas in real time, with zero lag.</p>

          <h3>&mdash; In it for the Long Hual</h3>
          <p>Where some see a neat hand-off I see an extended role of support - sheppherding a project toward completion, adjusting according to technical constraints, getting into the code-base, guaging feedback from stakeholders, and testing final products. </p>

          <h3>&mdash; Seeing the Big Picture </h3>
          <p>Individual projects can be incredibly complex but I thrive on the relationships between projects, how they relate to larger strategies, how systems together accomplish goals and produce meaningful outcomes.</p>

          <h3>Up for new partnerships in <span class="sector-1">education</span>, <span class="sector-2">clean energy</span>, <span class="sector-3">healthcare</span> and anything else ripe with meaningful problems to solve.</h3>
