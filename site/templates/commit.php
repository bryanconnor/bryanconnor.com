      <p>I teamed up with the core members of the <a href="http://commit2dallas.org/" target="_blank">Commit! Partnership</a> to help create 2013's <a href="http://commit2dallas.org/hot-presses-2013-community-achievement-scorecard/" target="_blank">Community Achievement Scorecard</a>.</p>

      <p>The Commit! Partnership is made up of 110 institutions, corporations, non-profits and school districts all supporting educational outcomes for the region's 500,000+ students.</p>

      <h3>SETTING THE TONE</h3>
      <p>Our first job was to outline the state of affairs by comparing the districtâ€™s goals with the actual data. </p>

      <h3>BREAKDOWNS</h3>
      <p>Because challenges within the student body are not distributed equally, it is important to examine the district by ethnicity, socioeconomic status and English Language Learner status. </p>

      <h3>PROCESS</h3>
      <p>Each page went through multiple rounds of revisions to hone the message and ensure the clarity of the visualizations. In the end, the report was something we could all be proud of.</p>

      <blockquote>
        As I flip through the report, I feel a sense of pride over what we accomplished and more importantly, what this document has the potential of accomplishing on its own. I also feel a renewed sense of urgency to get to work; we used too much red in the report this year. If we keep our heads down, every year we will use less and less.</blockquote>
