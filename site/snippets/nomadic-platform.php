      <p><a href="http://nomadic.fm" target="_blank" class="rsNoDrag">Nomadic.fm</a> is a digital learning company focused on preparing people to build, manage and lead businesses. They consult with academic and enterprise clients to build customized Field Manuals for students and deliver them through their platform.</p>
      <p>I worked with the Nomadic team to improve the learning experience on the platform by giving students better tools and shifting focus towards the social elements of learning.</p>

      <h3>STARTING POINT</h3>
      <p>The original platform laid a good foundation but didn’t feel like a coherent digital learning space. </p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <div class="rsContent slide4 centered-block" >
    <div class=" text " data-move-effect="none">
      <p>Early in the design process we experimented with multiple approaches to each feature and reworked how they all fit together.</p>

    <div class="text ">
      <h3>THE LIBRARY</h3>
      <p>The first major improvement was a clear library of content. Field Manuals began to feel like independent elements, each with their own title, cover image, and level of completion.</p>

    <div class="text ">
       <h3>HYPERTEXT</h3>
      <p>While each field manual is self-contained, its elements are accessible in different ways throughout the platform. For example, text and video can be favorited for quick reference at a later date.</p>

    <div class="text ">
       <h3>CONVERSATIONS</h3>
      <p>Each Field Manual contains its own debate section but the conversation hub collects them all into one central location. It also allows users to start new conversations, outside of those set up by program administrators, so they can discuss the content on their own terms. </p>

       <h3>LEADERBOARD</h3>
      <p>All of the activity happening in and around field manuals contributes to a leaderbaord. This highlights the competitive aspects of learning in a group of your peers. </p>

      <h3>FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT</h3>
      <p>I also contributed heavily to the front-end development of the new platform. One of Nomadic's goals is to enable learning anywhere, so we engineered the platform to be just as responsive as the learning materials it houses. </p><p>I worked closely with <a href="https://github.com/junhonomad" target="_blank" class="rsNoDrag">Jun Ho</a> at Nomadic all the way through implementation, making adjustments as we went. Some of the front-end work was also completed with the help of the team at <a href="http://www.inthebackforty.com/" target="_blank" class="rsNoDrag">Back Forty</a>.
