      <p>I sat down with Scott Messigner to talk about his idea for <a href="http://www.commoncurriculum.com/" target="_blank">Common Curriculum</a>. Together we set out to envision a lesson templating system that would help teachers align their curriculum to the Common Core standards.</p>

      <h3>EARLY VISION</h3>
      <p>We first worked on a series of wireframes and user flows to illustrate some core application concepts. These were circulated to teacher focus groups and potential investors for feedback.</p>

      <h3>PROGRESS</h3>
      <p>A few months later Scott reached out again as the team was preparing the product for launch. They wanted to iterate on the design and user experience and get some user-friendly prototypes in the hands of Baltimore City school teachers.</p>
      <p>We worked through static visual designs, interactive click-throughs and full-featured prototypes in code.</p>

      <h3>TEMPLATE LIBRARY</h3>
      <p>The systemâ€™s key feature is lesson templating. Teachers can build off of example templates, create their own, or share templates with colleages.</p>

      <h3>TEACHER TESTED</h3>
      <p>During several pre-launch events we watched as teachers tested the various prototypes and gave us valuable feedback, which we quickly incorporated into the product.</p>
      <p>The result was a fully-featured lesson planning tool tailored to the tastes of teachers. </p>

      <p>Common Curriculum officially launched with a <a href="http://technical.ly/baltimore/2012/08/23/common-curriculum-online-lesson-planning-for-teachers-officially-launches-at-maxs-taphouse/" target="_blank">party</a> at Max's Tap House in Baltimore. <a href="http://friendsoftheweb.com/" target="_blank">Friends of the Web</a> provided final branding for the tool as well as early working prototypes. Development and design work were eventually taken over by the core team at Common Curriculum who have since launched several new iterations of the tool.</p>
