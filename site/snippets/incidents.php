      <p>I worked with Austin from <a href="http://educatorshandbook.com/" target="_blank">EducatorsHandbook.com</a> to modernize and enhance the well-loved Incidents app. With an existing customer base of school districts, the behavior management tool needed to feel familiar, even with a host of new features.</p>

      <h3>WORKFLOW</h3>
      <p>Incidents is built around making the student behavior management process easier. Many schools rely on paper records and manual workflows. Incidents speeds this up considerably, scaling management and analysis to whole districts.</p>

      <h3>STUDENT HISTORY</h3>
      <p>A studentâ€™s entire history is accessible on demand, limiting excess consequences that would interfere with school. A teacher or administrator can see an overview as well as a full log of prior incidents to add context to the event at hand.</p>

       <h3>REPORTING</h3>
      <p>The power of Incidents comes from the high level analysis of when and where incidents are occurring. Administrators can diagnose problem areas by location, time of day, subject and more.</p>
      <p>Powerful filters give administrators the ability to focus on long-term trends or particular types of incidents. </p>
