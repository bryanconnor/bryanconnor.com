'I find a newsletter personal — more personal than a blog,' Dougherty says. 'It is addressed to you. It’s also a ritual in a sense. I wanted it to have that feeling of, it’s coming to you in a place you’re going to check. This is an email that doesn’t ask you to do anything. A lot of emails come from your boss or a spouse or a parent and they’re asking for something. This just asks to be enjoyed.'

This is what I want newsletters to feel like but the fact that they’re in the context of my inbox with all the other emails asking me to do something makes them hard to read and enjoy.
