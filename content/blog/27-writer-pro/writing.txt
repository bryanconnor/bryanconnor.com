I’m a huge fan of the original (link:http://www.iawriter.com/mac/ text:iA Writer) (and of this amazing video) but (link:http://writer.pro/ text:Writer Pro) falls flat as a significant upgrade. Its four writing modes change the document’s typography and some available features but not much else. I was hoping the writing modes would store different versions of the text in a package so that notes, drafts and final pieces could exist together.
