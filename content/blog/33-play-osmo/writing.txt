A pretty interesting technology invented by some parents from Google and Stanford. (link:https://www.playosmo.com/ text:Osmo) allows kids to interact with physical objects to achieve goals in iPad games. It blends the two realms in a seamless and pretty magical way. 

I'll think we'll see a lot more along these lines, with more sophisticated pieces using technology like bluetooth to enable them individually to communicate with the device.
