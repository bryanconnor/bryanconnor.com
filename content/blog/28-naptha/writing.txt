Project Naptha is a pretty incredible chrome extension that blurs the lines between text and image.

From (link:http://projectnaptha.com/ text:the projectâ€™s website): Project Naptha automatically applies state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms on every image you see while browsing the web. The result is a seamless and intuitive experience, where you can highlight as well as copy and paste and even edit and translate the text formerly trapped within an image.
