I want to be involved in better education, better explanation, better understanding.

particle man doesn’t explain much. no room for further curiosity.
the cosmos talks down to people

feynman does a better job explaining physics
stems from my interest in education and how I was taught concepts. I think this can be applies to most if not all subjects. environmental since, physics, history, politics,

thinking about exploring the world from multiple angles and connecting subjects. reading heart of darkness without knowing much about africa or its people. 

So i’m feeling this tension between analysis, formalization, thorough explanation and the need to keep things flexible, to be revised and to allow other contributors. 

Currently obsessed with the tension between the best way to explain information and the desire to keep the information flexible to revision

as well as the tension between informational depth and breadth in how people explore and learn concepts. 

like a documentary that gets updated and revised with new information and explains certain concepts better over time. 

Circa does this pretty well by compartmentalizing stories. But it’s still text on a page.
