I can’t recall whose tweet lead me to it (as so often happens) but thank you to whoever it was. I found myself on (link:https://assembly.com/octobox/ text:Octobox’s page) on (link:https://assembly.com/about text:Assembly), the platform for collaboratively creating software, and from there I was hooked. A beautiful, working bookmarking system that championed the importance of users owning their data by storing it all in Dropbox. And since it was on Assembly the potential is there for me to contribute to its success beyond just being a user. So I’m going to jump in and see how I can lend a hand.
