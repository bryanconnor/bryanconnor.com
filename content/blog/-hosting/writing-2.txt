Turning things into coherent thoughts is hard. 

Started by thinking about the barriers for artist to get their work online. mixed with my penchant for decentralizing and self hosting things. 

I tweeted about Semplice earlier which seems like it makes it pretty easy for artists to get a great looking portfolio online. Then I realized that the biggest hurdle for artist isn’t really the code itself but buying and managing hosting. 

This suggests a more all-in-one approach but wp engine is the only thing like it. 

I think it’s important for artist to maintain all of the code for their website on their own servers and not rely on big portfolio sites like dribbble or behance. 

But at the same time you’re still relying on your hosting company to not going out of business or dump all of your files. I guess there are more ways around this part though. Files can easily be moved to another provider and you can back things up. 

I guess I’m interested in a set of tools that are even easier to use than wordpress that would allow people to achieve similar results. 

I think dropbox has the potential to be the base-layer for this.  But it lacks the ability to run dynamic files.
