Some interesting hypothesis from HUGE about anticipatory design. Interestingly, they’re actively testing their ideas with a custom-built coffee shop. Also of note, the problem of too much choice is a luxury only afforded to the affluent. “These are peculiar problems of affluent societies. There are many places where the problem is that they have too little choice.”
