I hate to say it but with every new, seemingly useful, service I come across I feel a pang of anxiety over whether it’ll still be around in a year.

Sometimes I think I’m being overly cautious. A software as a service model doesn't doom a business to failure. But with each acquisition, security breach and shutdown I become less and less convinced it's a sustainable idea.

I wish the solution were as simple as purchasing and hosting my own instances of existing software but that's rarely an option. Only (link:http://getkirby.com/ text:a few) (link:https://variancecharts.com/ text:companies) offer this (and most (link:https://twitter.com/37signals/status/467057825878138881 text:never will)). Blogging also seems to be the only web task established enough to have generated companies who use this model. 

Why is this the case? Are there flaws inherent to distributed software? Is SaaS really a superior model? What can we do to become less reliant on the myriad of web services we use everyday? 


Blogging is one of the only web tasks developed enough to 

Only a few companies offer this model and most never will. 

Having my data and the underlying software under my control would certainly assuage my fears. 

Why isn't this model as popular? Why is blogging seemingly the only web-task developed enough to have spawned services that use this model? 

Blogs being the one exception there are no

But since only (link:http://getkirby.com/ text:a few) (link:https://variancecharts.com/ text:companies) offer this (and most (link:https://twitter.com/37signals/status/467057825878138881 text:never will)).


I feel the need to build my own tools. 

As a full-time freelancer, a self-hosted project management / client feedback tool is at the top of my list. 

Unfortunately this route is even less well defined. Unless you're a skilled developer accustomed to building tools for others there's no easy way to do this.

As far as I can tell, self reliance is the only way to guarantee my data stays accessible for the long haul.





Even better, I wish services more easily integrated with each other 






In a perfect world I could achieve a degree of self reliance by purchasing and hosting my own instances of software. But since few companies offer this (and most never will) I feel there's strong justification for us concerned citizens of the web to build our our tools. 

At first the idea of building our own tools sounds like effort wasted in re-inventing the wheel. But really it's an opportunity to build something for a user base; something that's completely in turn with your needs. 

Of course, execution is another matter. Unless you're a skilled developer accustomed to building tools for others there is no obvious path to take to build tools for yourself.

Sometimes I think I’m being overly cautious. Software as a Service and The Cloud are incredibly powerful (and profitable) concepts.

The feasibility of this is a separate issue. 


At first the idea of building our own tools sounds like effort wasted in re-inventing the wheel. But more and more I see it as a freeing concept. Tools made by others are imbued with their biases and ideaologies and popular tools are beholden to diverse bases of users.. The tools you make will be perfectly tailored to you. 

 {But I think in reality} it’s absurd to think existing tools perfectly address the needs of a massively diverse user base. 

Tool builders imbue their biases and ideologies into tools and hence they work best for like-minded people. I think we need more tool builders and more diverse tools. 

Each of us has our own biases and ideologies. It follows that tools that align to our biases and ideologies will help us work better. 

We’re constantly inventing new ways of working and our processes are so varied that
