<p>Google’s (link:https://www.google.com/get/sunroof#p=0 text:Project Sunroof) makes the tricky business of estimating energy savings from a solar panel installation strikingly simple by combining massive datasets and aerial imagery.<p>

The fight against climate changes is a war of economics. Entities at every scale are more motivated to make climate-conscious changes the more those changes benefit the bottom line. Project Sunroof makes that benefit obvious and easy to calculate, replacing a vague sense of doing the right thing with a practical justification. Beyond the big data calculations, Project Sunroof provides information on the solar installation process and will also put you in touch with solar providers in your area. A great example of a massive company helping out the little guy for the greater good.
