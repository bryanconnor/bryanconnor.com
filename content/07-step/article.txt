Originally developed by Inquirium in 2001 as a desktop application, it has since moved to the web and continues to evolve under the direction of UEI.

I've partnered with Inquirium on the design and production of several iterations of the tool. Work started with information architecture and simple user interface for an early web version. Since then projects have focused on specific data displays within the tool and recently a redesign incorporating branding done in house at UChicago.

STEP tools and training models are currently being used in 21 states and 39 cities.
