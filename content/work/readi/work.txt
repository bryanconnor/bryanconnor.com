I traveled to Chicago in Spring 2012 for a two day working session to tackle the core application concepts of (link:http://www.projectreadi.org/ text:READi) with the (link:http://inquirium.net/ text:Inquirium) team. The task: create a supported reading environment for high school students struggling with reading comprehension.

READi is part of a (link:http://www.projectreadi.org/research.html text:research project) lead by UIC and Northwestern University and funded by a 5 year grant from the Department of Education. 


Content in READi is organized into units and sections which have background texts to set the stage as well as primary texts that students focus activity on.

(figure: 2-Unit-One.gif  caption: Each unit has a central argument, notecards created from the primary text and organizers to help arrange these notecards into meaningful patterns.)

Students can annotate the text in order to identify important elements like key events, characters, and vocabulary. These elements can then be arranged into different frameworks like timelines or character groups.

These concepts were developed into working prototypes and tested  with 9-12th grade students across the Chicago public school system. The research project and work on the tool are both still ongoing.
