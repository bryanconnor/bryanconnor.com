(link:http://nomadic.fm/ text:Nomadic.fm) is a digital learning platform focused on preparing people to build, manage and lead businesses. They consult with academic and enterprise clients to build customized Field Manuals and deliver them to groups of students.

The platform was in need of a redesign to focus on the content and draw out the social elements of learning in a group. This is where we ended up.

Field Manuals contain core concepts, case studies, debates and other elements, many of which can be favorited, commented on and saved by students in the platform.  

Greater importance was placed on the social aspects of the learning platform. Users get notifications for activity on their comments have access to more global activity streams to keep abreast  of what their classmates are doing. The platform also employs the concept of a leaderboard and uses a badging system to increase engagement and completion.

The entire system is designed and optimized for mobile web. Students are expected to consume content this way and can use all the features of the platform wherever they have an internet connection. 

## Process

Getting to a complete working platform required lots of iteration along the way.

## Front-End Development

I had a hand in the front-end development of the tool and was really able to implement my designs with exacting standards. Everything from hover states to animations and responsive breakpoints were written and tested across the platform. This was my first real opportunity to write production level HTML and CSS for a product with a big user base. I wrote a little javascript to illustrate interactions paradigms so that at Nomadic (link:https://github.com/junhonomad text:Jun-Ho) could make them production ready. some of the front-end work was also completed with the help from the team at (link:http://www.inthebackforty.com/ text:Back Forty). 

The new platform is in the process of being rolled out to institutions and organizations around the globe.
